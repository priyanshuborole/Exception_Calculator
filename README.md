This repo is an exercise for exception handling in java.

Created a custom calculator with following operations:

4. Division

which throws the following exceptions:
1. Invalid input Exception ex: 8 & 9
2. Cannot divide by 0 Exception
3. MaxInputException if any of the inputs is greater than 100000
4. MaxMultiReachedException - Don't allow any multiplication input to be greater than 7000
